Include a line-view or block-view of your custom post types automatically in any page.

== Description ==

Pkj Page Source is a plugin that let's you list any custom post type as children of a "page". If you have a custom post
type "service", and you have a "page" that is located in "/services" you can get a list or grid view of all you're
services inside the "/services" page.

The  benefits with this plugin is that you don't need to repeat yourself when listing teasers for full-content of each
custom post.

Features:

- Can list any custom-post type as "Line views" or "Block views (grid)" in pages.
- By default uses grid system for boostrap 3 for "block views". This is customizable with hooks. If your theme is not
based on boostrap 3, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/peec/pkj-page-source/blob/master/README.md) to
implement it.
- By default responsive customization for grid view.
